 Syntactic, Build 53

**********************

Syntactic is a program that reads huge texts and divides common words in the text to categories. Here are some of its automatic categorizations in the Simple English Wikipedia:

	Cluster 17
	----------
	with, including, without, involving, containing, featuring, requiring, reaching, covering

	Cluster 52
	----------
	city, town, district, province, university, river, county, site, community, village, moon, field, state, series

It does this by examining contexts in 3-grams. For example, if the sentences

"the cat sat on the mat"
and
"the dog sat on the porch"

appear in the text, then the words "cat" and "dog" are likely to appear in the same category.

Versatility
**********************
* The program has a replacable class for parsing texts, so it can be modified to remove XML tags (or just read them), or any other modification in regular expressions.

* The program outputs JSON in a very chatty form (lots of info), which can be reduced quickly.
